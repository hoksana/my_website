       <p style="float: right;">I believe that taking a conscious approach to eating is crucial in today's crazy food world. Becoming what I call a Conscious Eater begins with a change in mindset. Eating consciously simply means to eat with awareness, knowing what we are eating, why we are eating it, where it comes from and how it will make us feel.<br>
       Eating consciously allows us to establish the right balance of healthy to unhealthy food, and flexibility to adapt, both crucial to maintain our sanity. Overtime, it creates a deeper understanding of one's body, where eating becomes intuitive and we eat according to our body's needs. </p>
